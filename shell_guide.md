## Intended Audience

This guide is specifically written for my classmates at Epicodus.

### Assumed Knowledge

[This page, essentially](epicodus-shell). You should know what cd, ls, touch, mkdir, mv and rm do. Also, this guide uses the `$` symbol to represent the shell prompt, as seen in your shell at Epicodus:
```shell
Epicodus-9X:~ Guest$
```
 Probably this is obvious, but I may as well mention as it's a typical convention.

## Summary of Content

This guide will cover basic shell concepts and some recommendations for configuration.

It will not cover scripting concerns or programming concepts such as loops and other control structures, and it will not cover variable/string manipulation. Those are extremely powerful features but if there's any truth to the [classic quip by jwz][jwz] about the challenges of regular expressions, that goes double for Bash.
This guide will also omit a full description of regular expressions.

## About the Author

Hi, I'm Kai. I'm originally from rural Alaska, I've bounced around the States and spent four years or so in Central America. I really wanted to stay down there and so I talked my way into a programming job and taught myself what I needed to know as I went. That worked out more or less okay but in the six years since then I've been mostly stuck working on horrible legacy PHP projects, and Central America didn't turn out to be a good way to meet business contacts. Other than that I've used Linux exclusively for about ten years now, and messed around with Ruby to the tune of reading six or seven books and playing with rails and pry. I am currently attending Epicodus.

## Starting Out With the Shell

![Bash command prompt][prompt1]

Welcome to the command line. The shell, like git, is a tool that developers love to hate. They both have complicated syntax and a tendency to punish errant keystrokes.
However, they're useful enough that we put up with the rough edges, and the larger the codebase you're working with, the more important they become. It becomes clear pretty quickly that things like mkdir and touch are much faster than trying to create file and directory structures, but the rest of the shell doesn't exactly go out of its way to teach you what you can do with it, and the [Advanced Bash Scripting Guide][absg] is not exactly light reading.
This guide is also not light reading but should provide a practical introduction to most concepts and some example usage, specifically for someone who wants to be a developer and not a script writer.


Learning the shell has been a ten-year process for me, and I'm not really an expert. This guide is the stuff I've learned and found useful.  It's definitely not all there is to know about this stuff.

### What is a shell?

The shell is the thing that executes commands and spits text back at you. You generally use this through a terminal program like OSX's Terminal.app. On Windows you might use cygwin or the new Ubuntu substystem ##NOTE also popular is git bash, git shell, and windows built in PowerShell##.
In more general terms, the shell is an command interpreter, which means that it's actually a complete programming language of its own. You'll also see the acronym "CLI" thrown around, that stands for "command line interface" as opposed to a "GUI" or "graphical user interface". Either way it's a way to talk to the computer in a fairly direct manner.

**That is a warning, by the way.**
 The problem with programming is that the computer always does exactly what you tell it to. There is a mistake you can make which is worth explaining before we even get past the introduction.

 So you want to remove all the files and folders in some directory, and what you intended to type was this:
```shell
$ rm -rf /some/path/to/a/file
```

But you make a small typo:
```shell
$ rm -rf / some/path/to/a/file
```

This will remove every file that you have access to. If you have administrator rights you can wipe the whole machine, and OSX at least will not stop you from doing this. **Be careful what you type**. Test commands to see what they do (for example, with `:p`) ##NOTE: what is :p, where to use :p?## before trying them for real.
Most of the time the only risk you'll run is having to restore something from source control or backups, but of course that requires you to use those things. And of course the flip side of this is that if you ever do want to do something crazy like type eight characters and wipe the whole machine, you totally can.

Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility. And yes, that's a line worth stealing ☺

### Why learn this?

Programming is fundamentally a way to save human labor, and that includes our own labor. Learning to use the shell effectively will save you labor as a programmer, and the returns on that investment are exponential. The more time you can spend **thinking** instead of **typing**, the more you can express in code, and the more you can express in code, the more you can change the world.

#### Bash vs zsh

By default on most systems the shell interpreter is a program called Bash. This is basically due to inertia at this point: if you're a shell script writer and don't know in what sort of environment your code will run in, it's best to target Bash since it's the default on basically all systems.
You as a developer should probably use something that sucks somewhat less. My recommendation is to use zsh in combination with the excellent framework [Prezto](prezto). This guide will note differences between the two where appropriate, but my advice is to just learn zsh.

> Note to Epicodus Students:
> To start using `zsh`, you can type `zsh` into any terminal. ##NOTE:maybe some small outline of what exactly this changes, etc?##

#### Bash Bashing

Bash as a programming language is primitive and ugly as sin, but it will probably run on any Unix-based system without modification. If you really need to be sure of the broadest possible compatibility, there's an even more primitive version of Bash called POSIX, of which you need to know only that it exists and that if you have to worry about what exactly it is you should probably seek another solution.

## Navigation

You probably know that you can press the arrow keys up and down to go through commands you've entered before, but there are some other keyboard commands that do useful things.
The way these are typically written is with a caret (^) substituting for the Control key (Windows) or Command key (Mac). ##NOTE: seems the ctrl key is what works on the school macs, not the command key## There's a reason for that, but it's kinda [arcane][caretascii].

The first one you should know is `^C` (ctrl+C). This stops whatever command is currently executing, unless you've locked the system up. If that happens you can probably still use the `kill` command, but you may also contemplate the failures in life that have brought you that point, your worth as a human being, and the fate of your homework assignment before hitting that panic button.

Usually holding CTRL/CMD and pressing right or left will scroll by word instead of by character. Here are a few more commands

* `^D` : this technically means 'end of file' but you use it to get out of things. If you're using zsh but bash is your default shell, pressing this will get you out of zsh and back to bash. This is also what you use to close SSH connections.
* `^A` : jumps to the beginning of the line. You use this when you forget something at the beginning of a command
* `^E` : jumps to the end of the line.
* `^P` and `^N` move backwards and forwards (respectively) in [history][#history].
* `^L` : clears the screen, just like entering `clear` into the terminal.
* `^R` : searches your [history][#history] backwards. This is amazing. My typical use case is when I try a command and it doesn't work, then I spend some time debugging why, then whenever I get done I don't want to hit up a bunch of times looking for that previous command. Hit ^G or escape to stop searching.

You can also search forwards in history, but the default command for this (`^S`) is usually bound to something else. So in order to do that, you need to have the following in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` configuration file:
```shell
stty -ixon
```

For a fuller discussion of the configuration files, see [Configuration](#configuration).

## Syntax

Bash actually doesn't have a lot of syntax. Pretty much things are commands, strings, or variables.

### Variables
Variables are declared like so:
```shell
$ FOO="some string"
```

and used like this:
```shell
$ echo $FOO
some string
```

or
```shell
$ echo ${FOO}
some string
```

And you might think, "variables, great! I'm a programmer, I use those all the time!" Well, not in shell scripts you don't, because you're not developing code that way (hopefully).
Variables are mentioned here for completeness and so you know what they look like. Try to avoid needing to use them. Do set some [environment variables](#environment-variables) though.

### Strings

There are several ways to write strings on the command line. Using single quotes:
```shell
$ 'This is a string!'
```

Double quotes
```shell
$ "This is also a string"

```

Heredoc
```shell
$ <<EOM
This is a multi-line string. It's closed by 'EOM' on a line by itself
  EOM <-- this does not end the string!
EOM
```

Strings enclosed in single quotes are evaluated literally (no interpolation or substitution is performed).
```shell
$ FOO='bar'
$ echo 'This string has a $FOO'
This string has a $FOO
```

Double quoted strings will do interpolation and/or substitution
```shell
$ FOO='bar'
$ echo "This string has a $FOO."
This string has a bar.
```

Heredocs can be told to interpolate or not, and they can also optionally suppress tabs. Why tabs? Well, indentation is important in shell scripts too, and you don't necessarily want that indentation to show up in your output text. The string EOM (for End Of Message) is used by convention, but it can in fact be any character sequence. You are not going to use these very often, but they are really useful for creating other files within a script.

```shell
$ FOO='bar'
$ cat <<EOM
This is a multi-line string.
It has a $FOO
EOM
This is a multi-line string.
It has a bar
```

Add quotes around the delimiter to suppress interpolation for literal output.
```shell
$ cat <<'EOM'
This is a multi-line string.
It has a $FOO
EOM
This is a multi-line string
It has a $FOO
```

Suppress tabs like so:
```shell
$ cat <<- EOM
		This is a multi-line string.
	It has a $FOO
EOM
This is a multi-line string
It has a $FOO
```

The perspicacious programmer will notice that the other examples used echo, and for the heredocs we used cat. Technically heredocs are a form of output redirection, not strings per se, and echo is designed to work with real strings.

## Redirection

This guy is called a pipe: `|`. It lets you chain commands together in very powerful ways. Its invention was actually a major milestone in computing (to be fair, 1973 was a far simpler time). We will get more into how you will use this in the [Unix Utilities](#unix-utilities) section, but here's a quick example that I use all the time:
```shell
$ du -h ~ | sort -hr | head -n 20
```

The first part of the command (`du -h ~`) lists all of the files in the home directory and their size in a human-readable format (megabytes and gigabytes, rather than just bytes), then passes that to `sort`, which does what it says on the tin, and then passes the sorted list to `head`, which gives the top twenty results.
 More succinctly, the command gives the top twenty largest files or directories. Pretty neat, huh?

Each program that executes in the shell has an input stream, an output stream, and an error output stream, referred to as standard input (`stdin`), standard output (`stdout`), and standard error (`stderr`). There are cases where you care about this, which will be covered later. However, there are some interesting things you can do with file I/O redirection.

```shell
$ find . -iname '*.css' > search_results.txt
```

The syntax is:
```shell
$ some_command > some_filename
```

The example command finds all files in or underneath the current directory, and the `>` operator writes those to a file. With Bash, `>` will overwrite any existing content without asking questions. Zsh by default will let you know that the file exists already. You can force zsh to overwrite the file anyway with `>|` or `>!`.
If you get a good handle on pipelining, you won't use this terribly often, but if you're doing more complicated things than you can express with a single command it can be useful to store the intermediate output somewhere.

In the same sort of vein we have `>>` which appends information to a file. For example,
```shell
$ >>~/.gitconfig <<'EOM'
[color]
    ui = true
[core]
    autocrlf = input
EOM
```

I'm liable to use this to add config information to the default `.atom` settings file but that may be the first time I've actually had cause to use this. If you are trying to log something using a shell script you might also find a need for this, but if you're going to log something you may as well use a nicer language to do that with.

The final bit of redirection that you can do is to take a file and slurp up the contents into command-line arguments with `<`, basically just reversing the operation of `>`.
```shell
$ grep 'class="red' < search_results.txt
```

You will probably use the pipe character daily, and everything else is more situational.

#### Other Pipeline Elements

So you want to run a bunch of commands on the same line, but you don't want to actually chain their output. You do that like this:
```shell
$ mkdir -p project/{img,css,js} && touch project/css/styles.css
```

The `&&` means, 'execute the next command __if the previous one was successful__'. If you do not care whether the commands succeed you can use `;` to separate statements on a single line.
```shell
$ rmdir project/font; rm index.html
rmdir: failed to remove 'project/font': No such file or directory
rm: remove regular empty file 'index.html'? y
```


## History

The shell provides some extremely powerful history commands which can basically prevent you from ever having to type anything twice. That's the good news. The bad news is that you need some basic knowledge of regular expressions for this.

The shell keeps track of every command it executes, up to some configurable limit, usually 1000 by default. If you type `history` it will spit out all of the commands it knows about, with little numbers by them. Slightly more useful is `history 10` (bash) or `history -10` (zsh).
![shell history][history]

So there are a couple things you're likely to use all the time, and it's good to know that the rest of this stuff exists. I'm going to go throught the long form first because it will help you remember the shortcuts, and it may be useful.

Firstly, you can redo any command by using its entry number from the history command as so:
```shell
$ !2205
history.png  prompt1.png  shell_guide.md
```

You can also snag (e.g.) the fifth command back
```shell
$ !-5
```

But far more often you just want the last command you entered, or some piece of it. On Linux I forget to use `sudo` ##NOTE: maybe explain what sudo is somehow succintly, for the ignorant folk?##all the time, and usually after I get done facepalming I'll do
```shell
$ sudo !!
```

which repeats the entire previous command.
You can also snag pieces of the previous command. You may recall that in regular expressions the caret (^) refers to the beginning of something (the line, usually) and the $ refers to the end. So you can type things like this:
```shell
$ touch abc def ghi
$ echo !!:^
abc
```
```shell
$ touch abc def ghi
$ echo !!:1
def
```
```shell
$ touch abc def ghi
$ echo !!:$
ghi
```

And all of that said, the thing that you will find most useful is the shortcut for `!!:$`, which is `!$`. You will very, very often be doing things like this:
```shell
$ mkdir ~/projects/ruby/new_project
$ cd ~/projects/ruby/new_project
```
You can instead do
```shell
$ mkdir ~/projects/ruby/new_project
$ cd !$
```

I use that one many times per day.
There are other complicated things you can do if you want, e.g. the third and fifth arguments, or a range of arguments, but generally if I need something like that I'll just hit up and use the ctrl+arrow_key (which goes backwards by word instead of by character) and just make whatever changes on that line.

## Substitution

Technically using something like `!$` is command substitution, but there a couple of things which deserve their own heading. The first is curly brace substitution, which is extremely useful.
```shell
$ mkdir -p projectname/{img,css,js,font} && touch projectname/{css/styles.css,js/scripts.js,index.html}
```

The first part of that expands to
```shell
$ mkdir -p projectname/img projectname/js projectname/css projectname/font
```

Other ways to use this: ##NOTE: what's everything in here do? {,.backup}? ln?##
```shell
$ mv file{,.backup}
$ git diff {branch1, branch2}:/some/file
$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-{available,enabled}/website.local
```

Another really useful thing is caret substitution, which just swaps one string for another in the previous command. ##NOTE: could use somewhat more explaining. IE "the ^ls^rm exchanged the rm command for the ls command in the previous line, executing rm some_file"##
```shell
$ ls some_file
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kai kai 0 Mar 20 16:50 some_file
$ ^ls^rm
rm: remove regular empty file 'some_file'? y
```

If you need to replace a string that occurs multiple times in the previous command you can do this: #NOTE: what's gs do?##
```shell
$ touch spam spamspam spamspamspam spameggsausageandspam
$ !!:gs/spam/meow/:p
touch meow meowmeow meowmeowmeow meoweggsausageandmeow
```

The :p bit at the end of the history command prints it instead of executing it. ##NOTE: ayyyyyyy there it is##

## Unix Utilities

Almost all of the command line tools have a manual, unless it's something built in to the shell like `echo`. Type in (e.g.) `man find` and you will be inundated with information.
If you're using something like `bower` which does not ship with a [manpage][manpage], you should be able to get a quick usage guide by passing it the `--help` flag.
If the tool is extremely badly behaved and does not respond to the `--help` flag, you can try `-h`. If none of that works throw away the tool and complain to the author.

The unix toolbox, comprising the shell and utilities, is ludicrously powerful, which probably has something to do with why you can get them on every major computing platform including (finally) Windows.
*I do not have a good handle on sed or awk. If someone wants to contribute a short description of the use of those tools, please submit a pull request.*

It should probably be mentioned that these tools were all written by different people and the flags and invocation tend to be somewhat idiosyncratic. `dd` is probably the best example of this. It's a tool you use to copy binary data in very specific ways,

### less

This tool (called a pager) is for when you have a command that spits out ten zillion lines of text and you care about some part of it, or for when you want to just view a file really quickly. Hit 'h' for the help menu, and 'q' to quit.
```shell
$ brew search ruby | less
```
```
$ less .gitignore
```

You can use `cat` to view short files, but anything longer than 40 lines is probably best viewed with `less`. It has some search abilities and other useful features.
The one thing it's not great at is viewing files that are being updated continually (logfiles). For that use `tail -f`.
[Prezto][prezto] has a neat feature where if you type `less` it will figure out how long the file is and if it's only one page it just dumps the text to the terminal.

### find

`find` is brilliant. The general form is:
```shell
$ find [location] [options]
```

You use this when you want to get a list of filenames in a subdirectory that match certain criteria, and especially when you want to do that and then do some sort of function to them. Usually I will use the case-insensitive name search and a glob (wildcard) operator (*).

```shell
$ find /etc -iname '*.ini'
```
It's good for things where you know some part of the filename but don't know where it might be. You can also use it to find files that have been modified within a certain timeframe, and you can limit how deep it searches too.

Many uses of `find` can be avoided with zsh, which has a `**` operator which recursively matches subdirectories, so you can do things like
```shell
$ rm -i ~/**/*.class
```

Normally `find` is just used to list some files, but it also has an `-exec` option which is often a convenient way to apply a command to the matching files. `Find` uses `{}` to represent the file. Why? Hell if I know.
```shell
find . -type f -name "*.php" 2>/dev/null -exec php -l {} \; | grep -v 'No syntax errors'
```

This does a syntax check on all PHP files and prints the ones that don't pass. Inheriting a repository where the above command is necessary is not fun, by the way. I don't particularly remember why the `2>/dev/null` part was necessary, but for the record that's how you get rid of error streams you don't want.

#### Silencing Errors

This deserves its own little subheader. The idea is that otherwise those errors are going to be passed as input to some other function that's probably expecting only a list of file names. `/dev/null` is a special file that discards all input to it, and the `2>` refers to the error stream.
There is also a `/dev/zero`, `/dev/random`, and `/dev/urandom`, and these spit out zeros or random numbers until you tell them to stop.
Mostly you need to know that these exist, and that you can do more complicated things with redirecting error and input streams if you really need to.

### grep

`grep` is just a text search function just like the ones in whichever graphical code editor you use, but the difference is that you get to use it with the rest of the unix toolchain. You can ask it to look for either literal text or (at least as often) a regular expression.

```shell
$ grep -r 'console.log' ./*
```

The above command will recursively search for the matching string in __all files__ (`./*`) (here the idea is to remove debugging statements before committing). However, if I'm feeling slightly less lazy and want to be more specific about what files are searched:
```shell
$ grep 'console.log' ./**/*.js
```

A slightly contrived example to show chaining:
```shell
$ brew search ruby | grep rails | grep -v jquery | grep -v redis
```

That lists ruby packages that contain the string 'rails' but not 'jquery' or 'redis'. Doing that any other way sounds like a lot of work.  

### tail and head

`tail` is used mostly for snagging the last few lines of an error log file, but as that is an occupational hazard for programmers (like the shell itself!) then it's actually pretty useful just for that.
```
$ tail -n 30 /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

You can also use it to watch files as they are being generated, with `tail -f`. `tail` is also used to grab the last few lines of some command output, generally some sort of sorted data. `head` is the reverse command, grabbing the first few lines of a file or of some command output. It's less useful, but if all you use it for is [listing large files in a directory](#redirection) then it's still worth knowing.

### top and kill

`top` is a process monitor that lists things in order of CPU usage by default. It can kill things too if you press 'k'. It will ask you what you want, and default to the highest-cpu-utilizing process. But if you have used the amazing power of your terminal to really lock up the system, your panic button is:
```shell
$ kill -9 $(pgrep chrome)
```

If you happen to know the process id you can give that to kill:
```shell
$ kill -9 1233
```

`kill -9` is an extremely rude way to end a process, and the process might be rude back. If your system is locked up and it's something less than a critical emergency, use your smartphone to Google the things you should do before using that particular number.

### Editors: vim, emacs, and nano

If you learn `vim`, you will never need another text editor. If you want to learn `vim`, there is a learning game called ["vim adventures"][vim-adventures] which should get you on the right path.
So far I'm not that clever.
vim is part of the POSIX specification and should be installed by default on any system with a unix-based shell (which since Microsoft created a Ubuntu subsystem is all of them).
`emacs` deserves a mention; it used to be pretty much a 50/50 split between it and `vim`, but it [lost][vimwon] the [Editor Wars][editorwars]. Reasons to use it would be "I want a command line editor, but `vim` is too hard, and I like Lisp and wearing out the control keys on my keyboard".

My preferred editor is Sublime Text, but on the command line I like `nano`.
Generally the only time I use this is when editing configuration files, but sometimes it's useful for doing quick editing on a staging server. I should probably get around to learning `vim` but it does take a little while to get productive with it. I suspect that the easiest way to learn is to simply use it exclusively for a week.
However, if you want a stupid-simple editor for quick config file editing, `nano` is hard to beat. It very helpfully prints all its commands at the bottom of the screen, and it can be made to do [syntax highlighting](#nano) too.

### ssh
-##NOTE: maybe move this down? the things below it seem more useful for our purposes. Not that SSH isn't great or anything.##

`ssh` gives you secure command-line access to some other system. If you're getting tired of typing your GitHub username and password into the CLI every time you want to push some code, congratulations! There's a better way. Unfortunately for my fellow classmates, we don't get to use this.
Which is to say, if you want to generate a new keypair every day, uploading it to GitHub and deleting the old one, knock yourself out.
However, since most people will not do this, this section is going to be something less than a full explanation.

Most often with `ssh` you will be opening a shell on another system, and you may or may not take the time to get your aliases and such set up there. However, if you already know what you want:
```shell
$ ssh hostname 'ls -lha ~'
$ ssh hostname 'pg_dump -u user some_database' > database_dump.sql
```

You can also use `ssh` to set up proxies and tunnels, but you probably won't. Do practice good [infosec][infosec] with this tool.
+**Your private keys need to be protected.**
+Never create a private key without a passphrase.
+Never re-use a key: create one for each site that you want to access, for each machine you access that site with.
`ssh-agent` will let you get away with only typing the passphrase for your keys once per session.

## Environment Variables

There are a bunch of what are called "environment variables" that are either always set or that are very useful to set.

### $PATH

This is a critical part of how your shell works. This contains all the places that your shell will look to find executables. ##NOTE: why would I do this? Maybe put the explainy bit at the bottom further up?##
```shell
$ echo $PATH
/home/kai/.rbenv/shims:/home/kai/.rbenv/bin:/home/kai/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

The format is paths separated by colons. The usual command to add to it is:
```shell
PATH=$PATH:/something new
```

That makes sure that you don't overwrite some important bit of it. If you happen to do that, you will suddenly lose access to lots of commands.
On the other hand, you can drop your scripts into any folder listed in your `$PATH` and set them to executable (`chmod +x`) and they will be available on the command line for you to call like any other program.

### $CDPATH

This is not a critical part of how your shell works, but it's still super useful. If you have all your project folders in a particular place (~/Desktop, e.g.) you can set your $CDPATH to that folder and then cd to any subdirectory without worrying about where you are. ##NOTE: could maybe be better explained##
```shell
$ CDPATH=~/Desktop/
$ ls ~/Desktop/
project1 project2 projectmeow
$ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
$ cd projectmeow
~/Desktop/projectmeow
```

### $USER, $HOME, $PWD, $OLDPWD

These are set by the shell automatically and they can be kinda useful.

* $USER : This is always equal to the current user's username
* $HOME : This is the user's home directory. If you're writing scripts use this and not ~
* $PWD : This is the current working directory
* $OLDPWD : This is the previous working directory

### $EDITOR

This is used by various command-line tools, including git. If you want to edit your commit messages with atom, you can set
```shell
$ EDITOR='atom'
```

or in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file
```shell
export EDITOR='atom'
```

On my system this is set to `nano` because it's pretty rare that this gets invoked on something where you want to have a more fully featured editor.

## Configuration

### Dotfiles and *.rc files

Many tools will read an rc file on startup. Most shells will read quite a number of files on startup. Not all of them will be relevant to your interests.
There are some files that are read when you are using the shell interactively and some that are run for non-interactive shells (startup scripts, e.g.).

The files you care about are `~/.bash_profile` and (far more often) `~/.bashrc` if you're using Bash. If you're using zsh then you care about `~/.zshrc`. This is where you will put your custom aliases, and set $EDITOR, add anything you need to your $PATH, set up a colorful prompt, and other such things.

If you want to reload your configuration, the following lines are equivalent:
```shell
$ . ~/.zshrc
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

You also have dotfiles which are configuration for various things. Those are the hidden files that begin with a period. Changing any of the config options is, well, optional, but you may want to do so.
Generally it's a good idea to [keep your dotfiles under source control][git-dotfile] but it's slightly trickier to get those set up on a new machine than your normal git repo, so if you do this, make a script that does these steps for you. ##NOTE: got a script/link/etc?##

### git

`git` has a number of configuration options which you should set using `git --config` instead of writing to `~/.gitconfig` directly.
It also has 'hooks', which are scripts it can run before or after you commit things.
+Post-commit hooks might be useful for, e.g. pushing the commits automatically to one or more repositories.
+Pre-commit hooks are vitally important and will save you from many stupid mistakes.
Yelp has a project called [pre-commit][precommit] that gives you lots of useful pre-commit options out of the box.

You will want to do a syntax check for any css, javascript, ruby or java files that you add to a repository.
You will want to trim trailing whitespace.
You will want to check for debugging statements so that those don't get into production code.
This guide will be updated at some point with more explicit instructions on how to do that.

A full description of git's config options is somewhat out of scope for this guide. ##NOTE: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config##

You will potentially want to add things to your `~/.gitignore` file. On OSX having `.DS_Store` in there is not really optional. ##NOTE: defaults: https://github.com/github/gitignore ##

### nano

On Linux, `nano` comes with a bunch of syntax highlighting files in `/usr/share/nano`. Drop this into your '~/.nanorc' file:
```shell
include /usr/share/nano/*
```

Those will do pretty well. For those using other systems, there's also a GitHub repo with [improved nano highlighting][nanocolor] that you may want to use.

### mysql

```shell
[mysql]
auto-rehash
pager = less
```

Put that in `~/.my.cnf` and get tab completion for table names and paged output. For a better interactive mysql prompt, use `mycli`.

### atom

TODO: find something useful to put here. ##NOTE: will happily start working on this another day, I've actually been meaning to do so anyway##

### ruby-related stuff

TODO: find something useful to put here.
Use `pry` instead of `irb`. [It's much nicer][pry-repl].
> Epicodeans: pry is available on all the computers already and it's a fun way to explore Ruby. To run it, just type `pry`. Then try `ls 5`.

## Epicodus Startup Scripts

My next task after getting this online is writing a decent startup script. I do recommend forking zprezto in order to make your own modifications to the .zshrc files. I'll update this section as I get things done.

## Cheat Sheet

It is strongly recommended that you create your own. This will firm up memory associations. ##NOTE: again, in free time sometime soon I will try to come up with something. Maybe even use...tables.../shudder##

## Problems with this Guide

I use zsh on Linux, so I expect there to be some differences with e.g. keyboard commands on OSX. Please file an issue in the repository and I will update this accordingly. Editing suggestions for style and content should also be reported similarly.
